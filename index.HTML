<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the W
  eb, is an information system where documents
  and other web resources are identified by
  Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such
   as https://example.com/), which may
    be interlinked by hyperlinks,
     and are accessible ov
     er the Internet.
     [1][2] Th
     e resources of the Web ar
     e transferred via the Hypertext T
     ransfer Protocol (HTTP), may be acces
     sed by users by a software application cal
     led a web browser, and are published by
      a software application called a w
      eb server. The World Wide Web is n
      ot synonymous with the Intern
      et, which pre-dated the Web in some f
      orm by over two decades and upon t
      he technologies of whic
      h the Web is built.</p>
